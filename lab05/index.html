    <p><article>This is my first Webpage. Startng this webpage I didn't know how to go about it or even start. I learned you just have to play with it till you form something. So far, i'm liking it because I get to explore and create things like webpage.</article>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>How to use vscode studio.</li>
    <li>How to upload to Github.</li>
    <li>How to make webpage</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Learning how to code is a very interesting step. I learnt a lot from using coding site like vscode and python. It makes learning fun and exciting.</p>
